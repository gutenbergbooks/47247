<p><i>Manassas National Battlefield Park preserves the
scene of two of the famous battles of the Civil War. The first shall
be ever memorable as the opening engagement of that great conflict, while the
second, fought approximately a year later, paved the way for Lee&rsquo;s first invasion
of the North. In each instance Confederate arms won signal success and
dangerously threatened the National Capital.</i></p>
<p class="tb">The Civil War was perhaps the most dramatic and significant event in
the history of the United States as an independent nation. It was the
climax of a half century of social, political, and economic rivalries growing
out of an economy half slave, half free. In the race for territorial
expansion in the West, in the evolution of the theories of centralized
government, and in the conception of the rights of the individual, these
rivalries became so intense as to find a solution only in the grim realities
of civil strife.</p>
<p>It was on the great battlefields of this war, stretching from the
Mexican border to Pennsylvania, that these differences were resolved in
a new concept of national unity and an extension of freedom. In the
scope of its operations, in the magnitude of its cost in human life and
financial resources, the war had few, if any, parallels in the past. Its
imprint upon the future was deep and lasting, its heroic sacrifice an inspiring
tribute to the courage and valor of the American people.</p>
<h2 id="c1"><br /><span class="small"><i>The First Days of the War</i></span></h2>
<p>The flash and the dull roar of a 10-inch mortar, April 12, 1861,
announced to a startled countryside the firing of the opening gun of the
Civil War. Two days later Fort Sumter surrendered. The reverberations
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
of this shot were to shake the very foundations of the Nation. Gone was
the period of apathy and indecision. Events now moved with lightning-like
rapidity.</p>
<p>On April 15, Lincoln issued his call for 75,000 volunteers, and soon
troops were pouring into Washington. On May 23, Virginia voted to
ratify the Ordinance of Secession, and the next day columns of Federal
troops crossed the Potomac and seized Alexandria and Arlington
Heights. Eight days later Richmond became the capital of the Confederacy
and the chief objective of the Federal armies in the East. Stretching
from the Ohio to Chesapeake Bay, Virginia constituted the wealthiest
and most populous state of the Confederacy. Here were to be found rich
natural resources and a heavy network of railroads and highways for
military transport. These military advantages, however, were somewhat
offset by the deep waters which flanked much of the state, increasing its
vulnerability to Federal attack.</p>
<p>Straight across the path of one of the main high roads to Richmond
from the north lay Manassas, a small railroad settlement, only a few
miles east of the Bull Run Mountains. Here the Orange and Alexandria
Railroad formed a junction with the Manassas Gap line which extended
westward through the Blue Ridge to Strasburg, near Winchester. By
seizure of this significant junction, located approximately 25 miles
southwest of Washington, the Federal army could follow the Orange
and Alexandria southwest to Gordonsville and thence proceed by the
Virginia Central eastward to Richmond. This, with good supporting
highways, would assure an overland approach that would avoid many of
the natural barriers found in the shortest route by Aquia Creek and
Fredericksburg.</p>
<p>The significance of Manassas was likewise apparent to the Confederates.
As early as May 6, Col. St. George Cocke, commanding the
Potomac Department, had received a dispatch from Gen. Robert E. Lee:
&ldquo;You are desired to post at Manassas Gap Junction a force sufficient to
defend that point against an attack likely to be made against it by troops
from Washington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first troops to arrive were two raw, undrilled, and ununiformed
Irish regiments from Alexandria, armed with altered muskets. By May
14, Cocke was able to write Lee that he had succeeded in assembling a
force of 918 men at Manassas. That he had a clear grasp of the military
significance of the area is seen in his dispatch to Lee the next day: &ldquo;It is
obvious, sir, with a strong <i>corps d&rsquo;armee</i> at Manassas, and at least a
division at Winchester, these two bodies being connected by a continuous
railway through Manassas Gap, there should be kept at all times
upon that road ample means of transportation. These two columns&mdash;one
at Manassas and one at Winchester&mdash;could readily co-operate and
concentrate upon the one point or the other.&rdquo; Here then was a significant
germ of Confederate strategy.</p>
<p>As a phase of this strategy, Brig. Gen. Joseph E. Johnston had been
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
sent to take command of the Confederate force of about 12,000 men
stationed in the northern end of the Shenandoah Valley at Harper&rsquo;s
Ferry. Here was the gateway to the North through the Cumberland
Valley of Maryland and here passed the great Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
which connected Washington with the West. But Maj. Gen. Winfield
Scott, then in command of the Army of the United States, had dispatched
Maj. Gen. Robert Patterson with a force of about 18,000 men
to seize this strategic position and to prevent, at all odds, the junction
of Johnston&rsquo;s forces with the Confederate army at Manassas.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><br /><span class="small"><i>Confederates Look to Manassas Defenses</i></span></h2>
<p>On June 1, Brig. Gen. Pierre G. T. Beauregard, the Confederate hero of
Fort Sumter, arrived to take command at Manassas. Two days later he
was writing President Jefferson Davis requesting reinforcements. At this
early date the defenses of Manassas appeared anything but formidable to
the eyes of an English lieutenant of artillery who, arriving at night,
viewed them for the first time: &ldquo;I could scarcely believe that this was a
great military depot, there being nothing within my range of vision to
indicate that such was the fact. The station itself was a low, one-storied
building, about seventy-five feet in length, with bales and boxes
scattered about; a house of refreshment close by was uninviting, and
except one or two small cottages scattered here and there, naught was
to be seen.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>By the end of June this picture had materially changed. The roads,
the fields, and the town were filled with soldiers by the thousands.
Around the junction massive fortifications had been erected running out
in different directions from the station. Through the embrasures of these
earthworks the muzzles of heavy cannon pointed menacingly toward
Washington. Acres of trees had been felled to give free range to artillery,
and at key positions along the front men were constantly on guard at
their battle stations. Camps had sprung up like mushrooms in the open
countryside, and here troops in and out of uniform could be seen almost
incessantly engaged in drill.</p>
<p>By June 23, Beauregard was able to advise the Confederate Secretary
of War that, in consequence of large reinforcements lately received, he
had been able to divide his forces into six brigades commanded by
Bonham, Ewell, D. R. Jones, Terrett, Cocke, and Early. Advance detachments
had been stationed at key points including Centreville, Fairfax
Court House, Germantown, the junction of the Old Braddock Road
with the Fairfax Court House Road, and at Sangster&rsquo;s Crossroads. With
the main body of his troops partially intrenched along Bull Run, from
Union Mills to the Stone Bridge, Beauregard watched closely the Federal
preparations for an advance.</p>
<p>As the tension mounted, alarms occurred with increasing frequency.
Bootless, hatless, and coatless men often dashed to assembly sounded by
the &ldquo;thump, thump of the big drums.&rdquo; Rumors of the Federal advance
&ldquo;filled every breeze.&rdquo; In a dispatch, dated July 9, Beauregard informed
President Davis: &ldquo;Enemy&rsquo;s force increasing, and advancing daily this
side of Potomac. He will soon attack with very superior numbers. No
time should be lost in re-enforcing me here with at least ten thousand
men&mdash;volunteers or militia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 17th Beauregard telegraphed President Davis informing him
of an attack on his outposts and requesting that he send reinforcements
&ldquo;at the earliest possible moment.&rdquo; Confronted with this crisis, Davis
acted quickly. Advising Beauregard of the dispatch of reinforcements of
Hampton&rsquo;s Legion, McRae&rsquo;s regiment, and two battalions of Mississippi
and Alabama troops, he ordered Holmes&rsquo; troops up from Fredericksburg.
The same day, through his adjutant, he sent the following dispatch to
Johnston in Winchester:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="lr">RICHMOND, <i>July</i> 17, 1861.</span></p>
<p>General J. E. JOHNSTON, <i>WINCHESTER, Va.</i>:</p>
<p>General Beauregard is attacked. To strike the enemy a decisive blow
a junction of all your effective force will be needed. If practicable,
make the movement, sending your sick and baggage to Culpeper
Court-House either by railroad or by Warrenton. In all the arrangements
exercise your discretion.</p>
<p><span class="lr">S. COOPER,</span>
<span class="lr"><i>Adjutant and Inspector General</i>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>Realizing that Harper&rsquo;s Ferry was untenable, Johnston had previously
retired upon Winchester, with Patterson in cautious pursuit. Receiving
Davis&rsquo; dispatch at 1 a. m., July 18, Johnston determined to elude Patterson
and join Beauregard as quickly as possible. By a forced march he
reached Piedmont where his various brigades entrained for Manassas
Junction, 35 miles away. Brig. Gen. Thomas J. Jackson&rsquo;s brigade was in
advance, followed by those of Bee, Bartow, and Elzey.</p>
<p>Thus, after approximately 3 months of hurried preparation following
Sumter, the stage was finally set&mdash;the drama of the opening battle was
about to unfold.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><br /><span class="small"><i>The Federal Army Moves Toward Manassas</i></span></h2>
<p>On July 16, Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell had reluctantly put the Federal
army in motion. In vain he had attempted to delay the movement until
adequate training could provide him with an effective fighting force
composed of the 3-year volunteers, authorized by President Lincoln on
May 3, but popular clamor would not be denied. Pressure for a forward
movement was heightened by the realization that the term of enlistment
was rapidly expiring for a large body of the troops. Further delay would
mean the loss of their services.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">

<p class="pcap"><i>Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell, in command of the Federal Army in the First Battle of Manassas.</i> Courtesy National Archives.</p>
</div>
<p>With excitement and high expectancy, the army, accompanied by
many notables in fine carriages, took the road 35,000 strong. Seldom had
the country seen such a splash of color as was presented by the brilliant
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
uniforms of the various regiments and the gaily fluttering national and
regimental flags. The first day&rsquo;s advance covered only 6 miles. Oppressive
heat, dust, thirst, and the weight of heavy equipment slowed the
step and caused considerable straggling.</p>
<p>Lagging spirits, however, caught fire with the triumphant advance of
Hunter&rsquo;s division into Fairfax Court House. As the head of the column
swung into town, Confederate units stationed there fled in such haste as
to leave large quantities of forage and camp equipage behind. In an
impressive show of martial splendor, the troops, four abreast with fixed
bayonets, paraded through the streets to the stirring strains of the
national anthem and other patriotic airs struck up by the regimental
bands.</p>
<p>From Fairfax Court House the advance moved cautiously toward
Centreville, with engineers and axmen flung forward to alert the army
to &ldquo;masked batteries&rdquo; and to clear roadblocks of fallen timber left by the
retiring Confederates. By noon of the 18th the main body of McDowell&rsquo;s
army had assembled at Centreville and now stood poised to strike.</p>
<p>During the advance, little or no information had been received regarding
Patterson&rsquo;s movements in the valley. Irked by this, Scott telegraphed
Patterson as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="lr">Washington, <i>July</i> 18, 1861.</span></p>
<p>Major-General Patterson,...</p>
<p>I have certainly been expecting you to beat the enemy. If not, to hear
that you had felt him strongly, or, at least, had occupied him by threats
and demonstrations. You have been at least his equal, and, I suppose,
superior, in numbers. Has he not stolen a march and sent reenforcements
toward Manassas Junction? A week is enough to win
victories....</p>
<p><span class="lr">WINFIELD SCOTT</span></p>

</div>
<p>To this, Patterson sent the following reply to Colonel Townsend in
Scott&rsquo;s headquarters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="lr">CHARLESTOWN, VA., <i>July</i> 18th, 1861.</span></p>
<p>Col. E. D. Townsend:</p>
<p>Telegram of to-day received. The enemy has stolen no march upon
me. I have kept him actively employed, and by threats and reconnaissances
in force caused him to be re-enforced. I have accomplished in
this respect more than the General-in-Chief asked, or could well be
expected, in face of an enemy far superior in numbers, with no line of
communication to protect....</p>
<p><span class="lr">R. PATTERSON,...</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The events of the next few days more than justified Scott&rsquo;s suspicions.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><br /><span class="small"><i>McDowell Tests the Confederate Right</i></span></h2>
<p>On July 18, in a feeling movement on the Confederate right, Tyler made
a thrust against Beauregard&rsquo;s troops stationed in the vicinity of Blackburn&rsquo;s
Ford. The affair got somewhat out of hand with the result that
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
the Federal force was smartly repulsed. The action had a depressing
effect on Union morale but greatly boosted that of the Confederates.
There then followed 2 days of costly delay for McDowell during which
time he brought forward his supplies&mdash;a delay the Confederates were
quick to capitalize upon. To the sound of the axe and the crash of falling
trees, they built roadblocks along the Warrenton Pike in the vicinity of
the Stone Bridge and in general strengthened their defenses. More
important, the delay gave Johnston much needed time in which to reach
Manassas.</p>
<p>Confederate reinforcements were now steadily moving in. On the
19th, Jackson arrived 2,500 strong, having covered approximately 55
miles in 25 hours. At sunrise of the 20th, more of Johnston&rsquo;s reinforcements
had come in&mdash;the 7th and 8th Georgia regiments of Bartow&rsquo;s
brigade numbering 1,400 men. About noon, Johnston himself arrived
accompanied by Bee, the 4th Alabama, the 2d Mississippi, and two companies
of the 11th Mississippi. The Confederate camp now became a
scene of busy activity. While the reinforcements moved up to position
in the line, Beauregard and Johnston conferred on plans for an offensive.
Candles burned low in headquarters that night as Beauregard and his
staff put the finishing touches to the Confederate plan of attack. At 4:30
a. m., he submitted it to Johnston, his superior, for the approval that
was quickly granted. The plan involved the flanking of the Federal left,
but the early movement of McDowell, the delayed arrival of expected
reinforcements, and the miscarriage of orders combined to prevent its
execution.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><br /><span class="small"><i>First Battle of Manassas</i> (<span class="smaller">SEE <a href="#map1">MAP ON PAGES 22-23</a>.</span>)</span></h2>
<p>Sunday, July 21, dawned bright and clear. The listless stirring of the
trees gave early promise that the day would be hot. Dust lay thick upon
the grass, the brush, and the uniforms of the men. The Confederate
camps were just beginning to stir from a restless night when, suddenly
about 5:15 a. m., there was heard the thunderous roar of a big gun in
the vicinity of the Stone Bridge. With this shot, fired from a 30-pounder
Parrott rifle of Tyler&rsquo;s command, McDowell opened the first battle of
the war.</p>

</div>
<p>Since 2:30 a. m. his troops had been in motion executing a well-conceived
plan of attack. In bright moonlight, across the valley from
Centreville &ldquo;sparkling with the frost of steel,&rdquo; the Federal army had
moved in a three-pronged attack. McDowell had originally planned to
turn the Confederate right, but the affair of the 18th at Blackburn&rsquo;s Ford
had shown the Confederates in considerable strength in that sector.
Further informed that the Stone Bridge was mined and that the turnpike
west of the bridge was blocked by a heavy abatis, he determined to turn
the extreme Confederate left. By this flanking movement he hoped to
seize the Stone Bridge and destroy the Manassas Gap Railroad at or near
Gainesville, thus breaking the line of communication between Johnston,
supposedly at Winchester, and Beauregard at Manassas. To screen the
main attack, Tyler was to make a feinting thrust at the Confederate
defenses at the Stone Bridge, while Richardson was to make a diversion
at Blackburn&rsquo;s Ford. Miles&rsquo; division was to cover Centreville, while
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
Runyon&rsquo;s division covered the road to Washington. To a large extent
the success of the attack depended upon two factors&mdash;rapidity of movement
and the element of surprise.</p>
<p>Turning to the right at Cub Run Bridge, the main Federal column,
composed of Hunter&rsquo;s and Heintzelman&rsquo;s divisions, had followed a
narrow dirt road to Sudley Ford which they reached, after exasperating
delays, about 9:30 a. m. Here the men stopped to drink and fill their
canteens. Though this loss of time was costly, success might still have
been theirs if the movement had not been detected.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">

<p class="pcap"><i>Sudley Springs Ford, Catharpin Run.</i> Wartime photograph. Courtesy Library of Congress.</p>
</div>
<p>From Signal Hill, a high observation point within the Manassas
defenses, the Confederate signal officer, E. P. Alexander, had been scanning
the horizon for any evidence of a flanking movement. With glass
in hand he was examining the area in the vicinity of Sudley Ford when
about 8:45 a. m. his attention was arrested by the glint of the morning
sun on a brass field piece. Closer observation revealed the glitter of
bayonets and musket barrels. Quickly he signaled Evans at the Stone
Bridge, &ldquo;Look out for your left; you are turned.&rdquo; This message, which
was to play an important part in the tactical development of the battle,
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
represents probably the first use under combat conditions of the &ldquo;wig-wag&rdquo;
system of signaling.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">

</div>
<h3 id="c6">MORNING PHASE&mdash;THE FIGHT AT MATTHEWS HILL.</h3>
<p>Since 8 o&rsquo;clock it
had been apparent to Evans that Tyler&rsquo;s attack was simply a feint. Now
warned of the approach of the flanking column, he moved rapidly to
counter it. Leaving four companies of his command to guard the bridge
with two pieces of artillery, he pushed northwestward about 1,700 yards
to a point near the crossing of the Warrenton Turnpike and the
Manassas-Sudley Road. There, about 10:15 a. m., he opened with artillery
and infantry fire upon the advancing Federal column led by
Burnside&rsquo;s brigade. Soon Col. Andrew Porter moved to Burnside&rsquo;s assistance.
Hard-pressed after a gallant stand of about an hour, Evans sent an
urgent request to Bee for help. Temporarily attached to Bee&rsquo;s brigade
was Bartow with two Georgia regiments. With his command Bee had
previously taken up a position on Henry Hill from which point Imboden&rsquo;s
battery had played with telling effect upon the flanking column
of McDowell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Bee moved promptly forward, taking up a position on the right of
Evans&rsquo; line about 11 a. m. Here the combined Confederate force of approximately
five regiments with six field pieces held stubbornly until
about noon. The arrival of fresh Federal reinforcements of Heintzelman,
and later of Sherman and Keyes, so increased the pressure on the Confederate
right that its defenses gave way. Eagerly the Federal columns
pushed their advantage as the now demoralized Confederates retreated
across Young&rsquo;s Branch to the shelter of the Robinson House Hill. Following
closely, Keyes moved downstream and took up a position in the
shelter of the hills where he remained to take little effective part in
further fighting during the day.</p>
<p>In a position near the Robinson House, Hampton&rsquo;s Legion, 600
strong, courageously attempted to cover the Confederate retreat. The
Federal attack, however, finally forced them back with the disordered
commands of Bee, Bartow, and Evans.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig14">

<p class="pcap"><i>Confederate officers rallying their troops behind the Robinson House during the First Battle of Manassas.</i> From &ldquo;Battles and Leaders of the Civil War.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>In the midst of the wild confusion that then ensued, as the fate of the
battle hung in the balance, there occurred one of the dramatic moments
of the war. Bee, desperately attempting to rally his men, glanced toward
Henry Hill where he saw Jackson and his command standing bold and
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
resolute. Catching the inspiration of the moment, Bee leaned forward in
his stirrups and with pointed sword shouted to his men, &ldquo;Look! There
is Jackson standing like a stone wall! Rally behind the Virginians!&rdquo;
Thus &ldquo;Stonewall&rdquo; Jackson won his famous sobriquet.</p>
<p>It was about this time that Johnston and Beauregard galloped upon
the field. In the presence of their commanding officers the men gained
new confidence. The line stiffened, formed again, and advanced to the
front. Reinforcements from Cocke&rsquo;s and Bonham&rsquo;s brigades, at fords
farther down Bull Run, were now fast coming up. Quickly upon their
arrival they were sent into position to the right and left of Jackson.
Johnston soon retired to the Lewis House (&ldquo;Portici&rdquo;), where he directed
the movement of reinforcements from the rear, while Beauregard took
immediate command of the field.</p>
<p>There now occurred a lull between 1 and 2 p. m. as the victorious
Federal troops crossed the valley of Young&rsquo;s Branch and re-formed for a
renewal of the attack.</p>
<h3 id="c7">AFTERNOON PHASE.</h3>
<p>About 2 p. m., McDowell ordered forward the two
splendid, regular batteries of Ricketts and Griffin, directing them to take
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
up an exposed position just south of the Henry House. At a distance of
not much more than 300 yards, these batteries were soon engaged in a
furious duel with the artillery arrayed in Jackson&rsquo;s front. For about 15
minutes the din was terrific. Finally, in an effort to gain a better enfilading
fire, Griffin advanced three of his guns slightly. The movement
proved fatal.</p>
<p>At this moment J. E. B. Stuart made a dashing cavalry charge up the
Manassas-Sudley Road, scattering the colorful Fire Zouaves who had
been advanced to the support of Ricketts and Griffin. Almost simultaneously
the 33rd Virginia regiment moved forward. Mistaken by one of
the Federal officers as a battery support, it was allowed to come within
70 yards of Griffin&rsquo;s guns. Suddenly the regiment delivered a murderous
volley, which killed most of the horses and men of both batteries. The
immobilized guns were seized by the Virginians, only to be recaptured
by a spirited Federal advance. In heated charges and countercharges the
guns changed hands a number of times, yet neither side was able to
employ them effectively. Their loss to the Federal command was
irreparable.</p>
<p>Federal pressure now became so strong that Beauregard decided to
attack. As Jackson penetrated the center of the Federal line, the Confederate
right swept clear the area in the vicinity of the Robinson House.
In a gallant countercharge, however, the Union brigades of Franklin,
Willcox, Sherman, and Porter surged forward to reclaim the lost ground.
In the attack, McDowell displayed reckless courage by climbing to the
upper story of the Henry House to obtain a better view of the whole
field.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig15">

<p class="pcap"><i>The Federal assault on Henry Hill in the First Battle of Manassas.</i> From &ldquo;Battles and Leaders of the Civil War.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The battle now raged with increasing severity as both sides fought
desperately for possession of the plateau&mdash;&ldquo;the key to victory.&rdquo; The
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
weight of Federal pressure upon Beauregard&rsquo;s left and right flanks so
increased as to endanger his whole position. It was now about 3 p. m.
The scorching rays of the sun beat unmercifully upon the exhausted
troops as Beauregard, at this critical stage, ordered yet another general
attack all along the line. Just then Fisher&rsquo;s 6th North Carolina regiment
arrived to take position on the Confederate left. With Beauregard leading
the charge, the Confederate line advanced to clear the field and
regain final possession of the Henry and Robinson Houses.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Gen. Thomas J. &ldquo;Stonewall&rdquo; Jackson.</i> Courtesy National Archives.</p>
</div>
<p>Despite the loss of the plateau, McDowell&rsquo;s position was still strong.
With his right anchored in the woods in the vicinity of the Chinn
House, his line stretched in a great crescent back of the J. Dogan House
and the Stone House to a position near the Stone Bridge. However, the
right held by Howard&rsquo;s brigade and Sykes&rsquo; regulars had become so
extended as to face almost east towards Centreville. Thus extended, it
invited an attack which the Confederate command was quick to mount.
Reinforcements, sent forward by Johnston, now rapidly moved up. In
the lead were Kershaw&rsquo;s 2d and Cash&rsquo;s 8th South Carolina regiments
followed by Kemper&rsquo;s battery. Quickly following these troops came
Elzey&rsquo;s brigade, 1,700 strong. This brigade of Johnston&rsquo;s Army, detrained
only a few hours before, had advanced to the sound of firing, led by
Kirby Smith. To the weight of these numbers was added still another
fresh brigade&mdash;Early&rsquo;s. Coming into position to the left of Elzey&rsquo;s
brigade, Early struck the Federal right in flank and rear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>The combined attack, delivered about 3:45 p. m., proved overwhelming.
The Federal line staggered and fell back, retiring across the field in
some semblance of order. A brief rally north of Young&rsquo;s Branch was
broken up by Confederate artillery fire. All other attempts to rally the
men proved futile. They had had enough. Now they continued homeward
by the various routes of the morning&rsquo;s advance. Bravely covering
the retreat were Sykes&rsquo; regulars and Palmer&rsquo;s squadron of cavalry.</p>
<p>As the main body of the Federal army retreated in the direction of
Sudley Ford, Keyes&rsquo; brigade recrossed at the Stone Bridge closely
pursued by a Confederate detachment led by Kemper&rsquo;s battery. Riding
astraddle one of the guns was the venerable &ldquo;Yankee hater,&rdquo; Edmund
Ruffin, who had fired one of the first shots at Fort Sumter. Dusty and
weary he had arrived upon the field in the closing moments of the battle
in time to hail Kemper&rsquo;s battery as it was passing. Eager to get another
shot at the enemy, he held precariously to his seat as the battery went
jolting past the Stone Bridge and along the pike now littered with arms,
accoutrements, haversacks, knapsacks, loose articles of clothing, blankets,
drums, and brass musical instruments left by the rapidly retiring troops.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig18">

<p class="pcap"><i>The Robinson House.</i> From a wartime photograph in &ldquo;Photographic History of the Civil War.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>After proceeding a few miles, Kemper&rsquo;s guns reached an advantageous
rise. There they were unlimbered and quickly made ready for firing. The
first shot, fired by the elderly Ruffin, hit squarely upon the suspension
bridge over Cub Run upsetting a wagon that had just been driven upon
it. This served to barricade the bridge to further use by other vehicles.
In quick succession more shots were fired. Complete panic now seized
the Federal troops as they fled in a wild rout back to Washington.
Adding to the confusion were the throngs of sightseers and fugitives
who crowded the narrow roads. The roar of the flight, wrote Russell,
<i>The London Times&rsquo;</i> correspondent, was like the rush of a great river. All
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
through the night and the rain of the next day the tide of soldiers and
civilians streamed into Washington. Attempts by McDowell to rally the
soldiers were in vain.</p>
<p>The exhausted, battle-weary Confederates made no effective pursuit.
Early&rsquo;s brigade and Stuart&rsquo;s cavalry did succeed in capturing quite a
number of prisoners, but the main Union force escaped. July 22 found
both armies in the positions they had occupied prior to the 16th.</p>
<h3 id="c8">EFFECTS OF FIRST MANASSAS.</h3>
<p>The news of the disaster was first received
in the Capital with incredulity and amazement, then with consternation.
Throughout the night President Lincoln received spectators of the battle
and listened in silence to their descriptions of the engagement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a few days,&rdquo; writes Channing, &ldquo;the North was dazed, stocks
went down, money went up, and people sat around with their hands
folded in despair. Then, almost as by magic, the scene shifted and stern
resolve took the place of the hysteria of the Hundred Days since Sumter.
Lincoln called for volunteers. The best blood of the North in all ranks
of society, in the East, in the Ohio Valley, and on the shores of the Great
Lakes responded. The new men went into the conflict with a determination
and a spirit that has seldom been seen and never excelled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the South, the news of the victory was received with great elation.
Thanksgiving sermons were preached from the pulpits while public officials
commemorated the event with congratulatory proclamations. In
the ill-considered opinion of many Southerners the war was over, yet
seldom if ever has so complete a victory borne such meager results. An
overweening confidence and a false sense of security developed in the
South a paralysis of enterprise more damaging to it than was the disaster
of defeat for the North.</p>
<p>The battle, however, as the English historian Fuller points out, was to
have a profound influence on the grand strategy of the war. &ldquo;First, it imbued
the Southern politicians with an exaggerated idea of the prowess
of their soldiers and so led them to under-estimate the fighting capacity
of their enemy; secondly, it so terrified Lincoln and his Government that
from now onwards until 1864, east of the Alleghanies, the defence of
Washington became the pivot of Northern strategy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though the men of each army had fought with flashes of steadiness
and exceptional courage, there was ample evidence to show the costly
result of inadequate training.</p>

<h2 id="c9"><br /><span class="small"><i>Winter&rsquo;s Lull</i></span></h2>
<p>Following the conclusion of the first Manassas campaign, the war in
Virginia &ldquo;languished&rdquo; until the spring of 1862. The North, smarting
from the humiliating defeat suffered at Bull Run, now turned with grim
determination to the mobilization of its resources and to the training of
the great land forces necessary to subjugate the South. Maj. Gen. George
B. McClellan, fresh from victories in western Virginia, was immediately
called to the command of the Federal forces around Washington. Soldierly
in bearing and engaging in manner, McClellan proved a popular
choice with the Nation and the army. With marked success he initiated
a program of organization and training of the great Army of the
Potomac. Recruits now streamed into Washington by the thousand. By
December, there were 150,000 in training; by spring, over 200,000.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Confederate army under Joseph E. Johnston remained
encamped at Centreville with outposts along the Potomac. Jackson, with
a detachment, was stationed at Winchester. It was during this time that
Johnston established a very strongly fortified position consisting of an
L-shaped line of earthwork forts and batteries connected by infantry
trenches that extended along the eastern and northern crests of Centreville
for a distance of approximately 5 miles. Gradually, on the approach
of winter, log or board huts were constructed for winter quarters for the
troops. These were so located as to permit the troops easy access to the
fortifications.</p>

</div>
<p>With the worsening condition of the roads the problem of supply
became increasingly difficult. It was then that Johnston built a branch
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
railroad from his base at Manassas Junction. This was one of the first
railroads ever to be used solely for military purposes.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><br /><span class="small"><i>Preliminary Operations to Second Manassas</i></span></h2>
<p>McClellan&rsquo;s failure to move against Johnston resulted in a restive public
and press. Richmond, rather than Centreville, now became the immediate
Federal objective. Learning of an anticipated movement against Richmond
via Urbanna, Johnston, on March 9, fell back from Centreville to
take up a position south of the Rappahannock, with his right resting at
Fredericksburg and his left at Culpeper Court House. This forced a
modification of McClellan&rsquo;s original plan. He thereupon decided to
make the movement by water to Fortress Monroe and from there advance
up the Peninsula upon Richmond.</p>
<p>On March 17, the Federal army embarked from Alexandria. McClellan
had anticipated the use of a force of about 155,000 men. The brilliant
operations of &ldquo;Stonewall&rdquo; Jackson in the Shenandoah Valley during the
next 4 months, however, so alarmed President Lincoln as to cause him
to immobilize nearly 40,000 of McDowell&rsquo;s troops at Fredericksburg to
secure the defenses of Washington. This, together with the detention of
Banks&rsquo; expected reinforcements in the Valley, reduced McClellan&rsquo;s force
to approximately 100,000, thereby materially minimizing his chances of
success. Seldom has so small a force as that of Jackson (approximately
16,000) so largely influenced the final outcome of a major military
operation.</p>
<p>Johnston, in the meantime, had reinforced Magruder at Yorktown.
On May 4 the town was evacuated, and the next day a successful rearguard
action was fought at Williamsburg, covering the Confederate
withdrawal to Richmond. The Federal army followed by land and water
to White House on the Pamunkey where, on May 16, McClellan set up
his headquarters. The next day the Federal forces resumed their advance
on Richmond.</p>
<p>Gathering a force of some 63,000 men, Johnston then determined to
attack. On May 31, in the Battle of Seven Pines, followed by the Battle
of Fair Oaks the next day, the Confederates were repulsed, and Johnston
was severely wounded. The command of the Army of Northern Virginia
now devolved upon Robert E. Lee, a command that he was not to relinquish
until the end of the war. Within 2 weeks the defenses of Richmond
had been strengthened and the morale of the troops greatly
improved.</p>
<p>By June 25, Lee had assembled a force of about 90,000 men, including
Jackson&rsquo;s victorious command from the Valley. The next day he launched
his great counteroffensive. In a series of desperately contested operations,
known as the Seven Days&rsquo; Battles before Richmond, McClellan was
forced back upon Harrison&rsquo;s Landing on the James. Though the campaign
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
was costly in Confederate casualties, Lee saved Richmond and
cloaked his army with a sense of invincibility.</p>

<h2 id="c11"><br /><span class="small"><i>Pope Concentrates Behind the Rapidan</i></span></h2>
<p>The failure of Fremont, Banks, and McDowell in the Shenandoah Valley
convinced President Lincoln of the desirability of consolidating their
armies under a single head. By order of June 26 the &ldquo;Army of Virginia&rdquo;
was created, and Maj. Gen. John Pope, who had won recent successes in
the West, was given the command. Shortly thereafter, Gen. Henry W.
Halleck was recalled from the West to be made general in chief of the
Federal armies.</p>
<p>To Pope was entrusted the responsibility for covering Washington,
protecting the Shenandoah Valley, and so operating against the Confederate
communications at Gordonsville and Charlottesville as to draw
off heavy detachments from Richmond, thereby relieving the pressure
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
on McClellan. On July 14, Pope ordered an advance on Gordonsville.
Lee, anticipating the movement, had ordered Jackson to this point the
day before.</p>
<p>On August 7, Jackson, having been reinforced by A. P. Hill, moved
toward Culpeper in the hope of capturing the town and using it in a
series of operations against Pope. Two days later he fell upon Banks at
Cedar Mountain in a sharp but indecisive encounter.</p>
<p>Lee now learned that McClellan had been ordered to evacuate the
Peninsula and reinforce Pope. Appreciating the necessity of striking
Pope before he could be joined by such heavy reinforcements, Lee moved
with Longstreet&rsquo;s corps to reinforce Jackson. Pope&rsquo;s force now numbered
about 47,000 effectives, while Lee had approximately 55,000.</p>
<h2 id="c12"><br /><span class="small"><i>Lee&rsquo;s Operations Along the Rapidan and Rappahannock</i></span></h2>
<p>Pope&rsquo;s center was now at Cedar Mountain, his right at Robertson&rsquo;s
River, and his left near Raccoon Ford on the Rapidan. Thus stationed,
his army was directly opposite Gordonsville where Jackson&rsquo;s force had
recently arrived. On Clark&rsquo;s Mountain (a high hill opposite Pope&rsquo;s left)
the Confederates had established a signal station. From here, stretching
for miles, could be seen the white tents of the Federal encampment
dotting the Culpeper tablelands. Spurs from Clark&rsquo;s Mountain paralleled
the Rapidan to Somerville Ford, located about 2 miles from Raccoon
Ford.</p>
<p>Lee was quick to appreciate the advantage this topography afforded
him. Massing his troops behind Clark&rsquo;s Mountain he might move under
its protecting screen, fall upon Pope&rsquo;s left at Somerville Ford, and cut
off his retreat to Washington. The opportunity held bright possibilities
of success, and August 18 was set as the date for the initiation of the
movement. Unforeseen delays postponed the movement until the 20th.
Worse still for the Confederates, Stuart&rsquo;s adjutant general was captured,
bearing a copy of Lee&rsquo;s order.</p>
<p>Thus warned, Pope withdrew his army behind the Rappahannock. Lee
followed closely on the 20th, crossing to the north side of the river. Pope
took up an advantageous position where he stood fast during 5 days of
feints and demonstrations as Lee sought eagerly for an opening on the
right. In the meantime, Stuart had captured Pope&rsquo;s headquarters. Thus,
Lee learned that 20,000 troops, composing the corps of Heintzelman
and Porter and the division of Reynolds, were within 2 days&rsquo; march of
the front. Within 5 days other expected reinforcements would swell
Pope&rsquo;s numbers to about 130,000 men.</p>
<p>The situation was so desperate as to demand a bold expedient. Quickly,
Lee made his decision. Jackson, with Stuart&rsquo;s cavalry comprising about
24,000 men, was to be sent on a wide flanking movement of Pope&rsquo;s right
for the purpose of destroying his communications with Washington.
Commenting on this decision, Henderson, the English biographer of
Jackson, says &ldquo;we have record of few enterprises of greater daring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With Lee and Longstreet covering the line of the Rappahannock,
Jackson began his march from Jeffersonton on August 25. He moved
through Amissville and Orlean to bivouac that night at Salem. The
next day he pushed on past Thoroughfare Gap and Gainesville to Bristoe.
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
Never did the &ldquo;foot cavalry&rdquo; better deserve its name, for in 2 days
it had covered approximately 51 miles. That night Jackson sent Stuart
and two regiments to Manassas Junction to capture Pope&rsquo;s great base of
supplies. The task was accomplished with little effort.</p>

</div>
<p>The next day Jackson left Ewell to cover the rear at Bristoe and moved
with the rest of his command to Manassas Junction. There then followed
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
a scene of feasting and plunder the like of which has seldom been
witnessed. Knapsacks, haversacks, and canteens were filled with articles
of every description. Added to vast quantities of quartermaster and commissary
supplies were innumerable luxuries from sutler stores, including
expensive liquors and imported wines. An eyewitness writes, &ldquo;To see a
starving man eating lobster salad &amp; drinking rhine wine, barefooted
&amp; in tatters was curious; the whole thing is indescribable.&rdquo; What
could not be eaten or carried away was finally put to the torch. With the
destruction of these supplies one of the chief objectives of the campaign
had been accomplished.</p>
<h2 id="c13"><br /><span class="small"><i>Second Battle of Manassas</i> (<span class="smaller">SEE <a href="#map2">MAP ON PAGES 28-29</a>.</span>)</span></h2>
<h3 id="c14">FIRST PHASE&mdash;BRISTOE AND MANASSAS, AUGUST 27.</h3>
<p>Pope, now advised
of the presence of Jackson in his rear, immediately ordered a concentration
of his forces in order to crush him. McDowell&rsquo;s and Sigel&rsquo;s corps,
together with the division of Reynolds, were to move to Gainesville,
while Reno&rsquo;s corps, with Kearny&rsquo;s division of Heintzelman&rsquo;s corps, was
to concentrate at Greenwich. By these dispositions Pope hoped to intercept
any reinforcements coming to Jackson by way of Thoroughfare
Gap. With Hooker&rsquo;s division of Heintzelman&rsquo;s corps Pope moved along
the railroad to Manassas Junction.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of August 27, Hooker attacked Ewell and drove him
back upon Bristoe. During the night, Ewell retired to Manassas where
he joined the rest of Jackson&rsquo;s force. Pope now learned for the first time
that the whole of Jackson&rsquo;s command was at Manassas. New orders were
issued for a concentration at that point. Porter was ordered to march at
1 a. m. of the 28th from Warrenton Junction and be in position at Bristoe
by daylight. McDowell, Sigel, and Reno were to move at dawn upon
Manassas Junction, while Kearny was to advance at the same hour upon
Bristoe.</p>
<p>About 3 a. m., August 28, Jackson began to move out of Manassas
toward Groveton. In order to mystify and mislead Pope, he sent Taliaferro
along the Manassas-Sudley Road, Ewell along the Centreville Road
via Blackburn&rsquo;s Ford and the Stone Bridge to Groveton, and A. P. Hill
to Centreville and thence along the Warrenton Pike to a position near
Sudley Church.</p>
<p>Moving with Kearny&rsquo;s division, Pope arrived at Manassas Junction
at noon, to find the town deserted. Later in the day, word was
received that the Confederates had been seen in Centreville. Pope
thereupon ordered a concentration at this place in the belief that
Jackson&rsquo;s whole force was there. The corps of Heintzelman and
Reno moved along the Centreville Road; Sigel and Reynolds along the
Manassas-Sudley Road; King&rsquo;s division of McDowell&rsquo;s corps along the
Warrenton Pike.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>

</div>
<h3 id="c15">SECOND PHASE&mdash;GROVETON, AUGUST 28.</h3>
<p>Jackson had but a short time
before concentrated north of the turnpike when word was received that
King&rsquo;s Federal column was approaching from Gainesville. There was now
need for a quick decision. To allow King to pass unmolested would
defeat the purpose of the campaign by permitting Pope to assume an
impregnable position on the heights at Centreville. To attack, without
assurance as to when Longstreet would arrive, was to invite the assault
of Pope&rsquo;s whole force with possible fatal consequences. Without hesitation
he ordered the divisions of Taliaferro and Ewell to advance. A
fierce and stubborn fight ensued which resulted in heavy losses on both
sides. Finally, about 9 p. m., King withdrew towards Manassas.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Longstreet had reached Thoroughfare Gap at about
3 p. m. of the same day to find his way blocked by Federal troops under
Ricketts. Outmaneuvering his opponent by way of Hopewell Gap, he
forced him to fall back to Gainesville. That night, without informing
Pope of their intentions, King and Ricketts decided to move towards
Manassas. This enabled Longstreet to effect an easy junction with Jackson
in the afternoon of the following day.</p>
<h3 id="c16">THIRD PHASE&mdash;MAIN BATTLE, AUGUST 29-30.</h3>
<p>When Pope learned of
the engagement of Groveton he mistakenly decided that King had met
the head of Jackson&rsquo;s column in retreat. Confident of success, he ordered
a concentration of his leg weary troops to crush the Confederate force.
Sigel and Reynolds were to attack at dawn, reinforced by Heintzelman
and Reno. McDowell and Porter were ordered to reverse their course
and push toward Gainesville in an effort to cut off Jackson&rsquo;s retreat.
The text of this order known as the &ldquo;Joint Order,&rdquo; which was received
about noon, reads as follows:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<div class="img" id="map2">
<img src="images/map2_lr.jpg" alt="THE BATTLE OF SECOND MANASSAS, JULY 21, 1862" width="500" height="663" />
<p class="center"><span class="small"><a href="images/map2_hr.jpg">[High-resolution Map]</a></span></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Headquarters Army of Virginia</span></span>
<span class="lr"><i>Centreville, August</i> 29, 1862.</span></p>
<p>Generals McDowell and Porter:</p>
<p>You will please move forward with your joint commands toward
Gainesville. I sent General Porter written orders to that effect an hour
and a half ago. Heintzelman, Sigel, and Reno are moving on the Warrenton
turnpike, and must now be not far from Gainesville. I desire
that as soon as communication is established between this force and
your own the whole command shall halt. It may be necessary to fall
back behind Bull Run at Centreville to-night. I presume it will be so,
on account of our supplies....</p>
<p>If any considerable advantages are to be gained by departing from
this order it will not be strictly carried out. One thing must be had in
view, that the troops must occupy a position from which they can
reach Bull Run to-night or by morning. The indications are that the
whole force of the enemy is moving in this direction at a pace that will
bring them here by to-morrow night or the next day. My own headquarters
will be for the present with Heintzelman&rsquo;s corps or at this
place.</p>
<p><span class="lr">Jno. Pope,</span>
<span class="lr"><i>Major-General, Commanding.</i></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prior to the receipt of the &ldquo;Joint Order,&rdquo; Porter had reversed his
course to Centreville and had moved as far as Dawkin&rsquo;s Branch, located
about 3 miles from Gainesville. Finding the Confederates strongly
posted in his front, he deployed a brigade of his leading division and
waited. McDowell, who arrived shortly thereafter, showed him a dispatch
he had received a few minutes before from Buford, who commanded
the Union cavalry on the right. The dispatch stated that 17
regiments, 1 battery, and 500 cavalry had passed through Gainesville
about 8:45 a. m. This was the advance of Longstreet&rsquo;s command which
had left Thoroughfare Gap early that morning and now, followed by
heavy reinforcements, was moving into position on Jackson&rsquo;s right
(Porter&rsquo;s front).</p>
<p>This information, the generals felt, had not reached Pope. After a conference,
it was decided that in face of this new development they would
take advantage of the latitude the order granted: McDowell would move
towards Groveton, while Porter would remain in the vicinity of his
present position.</p>
<p>The relative quiet in this sector was in sharp contrast to the heavy
fighting now taking place along Jackson&rsquo;s front. With about 18,000 infantry
and 40 guns, Jackson had taken up a position along an unfinished
railroad bed which extended from near Sudley Springs 2 miles southwesterly
to Groveton. The grades and cuts of this road provided ready-made
entrenchments and formed a very strong position. There, shortly
after sunrise, Sigel&rsquo;s and Reynolds&rsquo; columns were seen at a distance
deploying for the attack. About 7 a. m., the Federal batteries opened fire.
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
By 10:30 a. m., a number of sharp skirmishes had taken place, but no
general assault had been made. About this time Federal reinforcements
of Reno and Kearny reached the field. It was not until 2 p. m., however,
that the battle reached its height. All afternoon in violent but uncoordinated
attacks, blue columns gallantly assaulted Jackson&rsquo;s line. At one
point the Confederate left was pushed back dangerously near the breaking
point, but the gray line steadied and held. Towards dusk, King&rsquo;s
division, of McDowell&rsquo;s corps, arrived in time to take part in the action,
engaging a part of Longstreet&rsquo;s command which was then advancing on
a reconnaissance.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig27">

<p class="pcap"><i>Maj. Gen. Fitz-John Porter, in command of the Fifth Army Corps at the Second Battle of Manassas.</i> Courtesy Library of Congress.</p>
</div>
<p>Pope, still unaware of the arrival of Longstreet on the field, late in the
day sent Porter the following order to attack Jackson&rsquo;s right at once:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Headquarters in the Field</span>,</span>
<span class="lr"><i>August 29</i>&mdash;4:30 p. m.</span></p>
<p>Major-General Porter:</p>
<p>Your line of march brings you in on the enemy&rsquo;s right flank. I desire
you to push forward into action at once on the enemy&rsquo;s flank, and, if
possible, on his rear, keeping your right in communication with General
Reynolds. The enemy is massed in the woods in front of us, but
can be shelled out as soon as you engage their flank. Keep heavy reserves
and use your batteries, keeping well closed to your right all the
time. In case you are obliged to fall back, do so to your right and rear,
so as to keep you in close communication with the right wing.</p>
<p><span class="lr">John Pope,</span>
<span class="lr"><i>Major-General, Commanding.</i></span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>This order, dated 4:30 p. m., was received by Porter at Bethlehem
Church about 6:30 p. m. Upon receipt of the order Porter immediately
sent his chief of staff, Locke, to order Morell&rsquo;s division to attack. Shortly
thereafter Porter rode to the front to find Morell&rsquo;s preparations for the
attack complete. By this time, however, it was so late that Porter decided
to rescind the order.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>During the night the Confederates retired from the advance positions
gained during the day to their original battle line. This fact was discovered
by McDowell and Heintzelman in a reconnaissance on the evening
of the 29th and confirmed by paroled Federal prisoners the following
morning. This led Pope falsely to assume that Lee was in retreat to
Thoroughfare Gap. Immediately plans were initiated to press a vigorous
pursuit. At midnight the following order was issued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Headquarters, Near Groveton</span>,</span>
<span class="lr"><i>August 30</i>, 1862&mdash;12 M.</span></p>
<p>Special Orders, No.&mdash;</p>
<p>The following forces will be immediately thrown forward in pursuit
of the enemy and press him vigorously during the whole day. Major-General
McDowell is assigned to the command of the pursuit; Major-General
Porter&rsquo;s corps will push forward on the Warrenton turnpike,
followed by the divisions of Brigadier-Generals King and Reynolds.
The division of Brigadier-General Ricketts will pursue the Hay Market
road, followed by the corps of Major-General Heintzelman....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At 3 a. m. of the 30th, Porter received Pope&rsquo;s dispatch ordering him to
march his command immediately to the field of battle of the previous
day. In compliance with this order he promptly withdrew from his position
facing Longstreet and marched rapidly along the Sudley Road to
the center of the battlefield where he reported to Pope for orders.
Though this movement strengthened the center, it dangerously weakened
the Federal left.</p>
<p>From its contracted left near Groveton, the Federal line now extended
approximately 3 miles to Bull Run near Sudley Church. The opposing
Confederate line was about 4 miles long. Jackson held the left along the
unfinished railroad, while Longstreet held the right, with the main body
of his troops &ldquo;bent to the front&rdquo; south of the Warrenton Pike. A heavy
concentration of artillery was placed on high ground between the two
wings. These guns commanded the open fields and the stretch of woods
near Jackson&rsquo;s right and center.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Preparations completed about midafternoon, the Federal columns of
Porter and Heintzelman advanced three lines deep, preceded by a swarm
of skirmishers and supported by great masses of men and guns in the
rear. A strange quiet pervaded the fields as the unsuspecting troops
pushed forward. Behind their protective cover, the Confederates watched
the lines draw closer; then suddenly opened upon them a rapid artillery
fire. Instantly, the infantry bugles sounded the alarm alerting Jackson&rsquo;s
men to action. The Federal advance line halted and staggered back.
Other brigades quickly pushed forward only to be broken by the raking
force of the fire.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig28">
<img src="images/p030.jpg" alt="Some of Jackson&rsquo;s Confederates, their ammunition exhausted, hurling rocks at the advancing Federals, during the Second Battle of Manassas. From &ldquo;Battles and Leaders of the Civil War.&rdquo;" width="500" height="393" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Some of Jackson&rsquo;s Confederates, their ammunition exhausted, hurling rocks at the advancing Federals, during the Second Battle of Manassas.</i> From &ldquo;Battles and Leaders of the Civil War.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Soon it was apparent that the main Federal assault was being directed
by Porter and Hatch against Jackson&rsquo;s right and center held by the divisions
of Starke and Lawton. In gallant style, a third line moved up and
impetuously pressed the attack. The force of this forward movement
pushed back the famous Stonewall brigade, but later it reestablished its
lines in a desperate countercharge. Heavy fighting at close quarters now
ensued. At one point in their line near a section of the railroad bed
known as the &ldquo;Deep Cut,&rdquo; Jackson&rsquo;s veterans, with ammunition exhausted,
partially repelled an attack with stones from the embankment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>Finally, the pressure became so great that Jackson sent an urgent request
for reinforcements. Lee then ordered forward a brigade from
Longstreet&rsquo;s command. Anticipating the request, Longstreet had already
moved up the batteries of Stephen D. Lee, which now opened a withering
fire on the Federal columns on Jackson&rsquo;s right and center. The effect
was devastating. Within 15 minutes the whole aspect of the battle had
changed.</p>
<p>Shortly after the Federal brigades had engaged Jackson along the
unfinished railroad, Pope had ordered Reynolds&rsquo; division from his left
at Bald Hill to move up and support the attack on the right. The weight
of his numbers, however, proved insufficient to stem the tide of retreat
that had now set in. Quickly, Jackson ordered up two brigades to press
a counterattack, moving forward his artillery as the infantry advanced.</p>
<p>The transfer of Reynolds&rsquo; division had again greatly weakened the
Federal left. Lee saw this and realized that here at last was the opportunity
for which he had been waiting. The order was sent immediately
to Longstreet to deliver the counterstroke. Every regiment, battery, and
squadron of both wings of the army were to be employed. By sheer
weight of numbers the attack was to be driven home in successive waves

<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Again, Longstreet had anticipated the order for which he had been
preparing since dawn. The long gray lines of infantry, restive for the
fray, now swept forward in a furious assault. In advance came Hood&rsquo;s
Texans, their colors gleaming red in the evening sun. Above the thunderous
roar of artillery and the noise of battle could be heard the shrill
cries of the rebel yell echoing through the Groveton valley. So intense
was the excitement that only with the greatest difficulty could the
officers restrain their men. Rapidly moving up in support came the
divisions of Anderson, Kemper, and D. R. Jones. Across the rolling
fields the attack pushed to gain the promontory of Chinn Ridge despite a
stubborn defense by the Union brigades of McClean, Tower, and Milroy,
while Jackson&rsquo;s veterans successfully assailed Buck Hill.</p>
<p>On Henry Hill, poignant with memories of the previous year, were
now assembled Reynolds&rsquo; divisions, Sykes&rsquo; regulars, and other available
troops. With courage and gallantry that matched the crisis of battle,
they hurled back repeated Confederate assaults that continued until dark.
The successful defense of Henry Hill made possible Pope&rsquo;s retreat over
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
Bull Run, by the Stone Bridge and other fords, to the strong defenses of
the Centreville plateau.</p>

<h3 id="c17">FOURTH PHASE&mdash;CHANTILLY, SEPTEMBER 1.</h3>
<p>Considering the Centreville
position as unfavorable for attack, Lee sent Jackson by Sudley Ford to
the Little River Turnpike in an effort to turn the Federal right and
threaten communications with Washington. The movement, however,
was anticipated by Pope, and the divisions of Stevens and Kearny were
sent to check it. In a sharp contest, fought in a rainstorm at Chantilly
on September 1, Stevens and Kearny were killed; but Jackson was repulsed.
During the next 2 days Pope retired to the defenses of
Washington.</p>

<h3 id="c18">RESULTS OF SECOND BATTLE OF MANASSAS.</h3>
<p>Second Manassas offers an
interesting contrast to the opening battle which had found two armies
of raw, undisciplined volunteers courageously but falteringly battling
for supremacy. The raw volunteers had now been replaced by seasoned
veterans, hardened by months of strenuous campaigning. The campaign
just ended had been one to test to the utmost the endurance and discipline
of the men in the ranks of both armies&mdash;a test they had met with
valor and high honor. In contrast to the rout of First Manassas, the
Federal army which now retired upon Washington was a weary but defiant
fighting machine. Its defeat had been accomplished by exceptional
daring, combined with a skillful coordination of Confederate commands.
Gambling with long chances, Lee had succeeded in removing some
150,000 invading troops from deep in Virginia and reversing the threat
of impending attack upon the opposing capital.</p>
<p>Commenting upon the battle, Henderson, the English soldier and
historian, writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... If, as Moltke avers, the junction of two armies on the field of
battle is the highest achievement of military genius, the campaign
against Pope has seldom been surpassed; and the great counter-stroke
at Manassas is sufficient in itself to make Lee&rsquo;s reputation as a tactician....
It was not due to the skill of Lee that Pope weakened his left at
the crisis of battle. But in the rapidity with which the opportunity was
seized, in the combination of the three arms, and in the vigour of the
blow, Manassas is in no way inferior to Austerlitz or Salamanca.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This brilliant success did much to offset Confederate reverses in the
West&mdash;the loss of Missouri, the defeats of Forts Henry and Donelson,
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
Shiloh, and the fall of Nashville, New Orleans, and Memphis. Contrary
to the inactivity that followed First Manassas, Lee pressed his victory by
the first invasion of the North. On September 4, he began moving his
troops across the Potomac with the hope of winning the support of
Maryland and possibly the recognition of the Confederacy by foreign
powers. In the desperately fought battle of Antietam, September 17, at
Sharpsburg, Md., however, these hopes were dashed by McClellan, now
returned to Federal command.</p>

<h2 id="c19"><br /><span class="small"><i>The War After Second Manassas</i></span></h2>
<p>From Antietam, Lee retired to Virginia. With the coming of winter
snows he bloodily repelled Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside in the Battle
of Fredericksburg, December 13, 1862. In the spring, Confederate arms
achieved brilliant success in the defeat of Maj. Gen. Joseph E. Hooker
in the Battle of Chancellorsville, May 1-6, 1863. Capitalizing on his victory,
Lee again invaded the North. At Gettysburg, July 1-3, he was
defeated by Maj. Gen. George Gordon Meade. The next day saw the
end of one of the most brilliant and decisive operations of the war with
the surrender of Vicksburg to Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. Its fall cut
the Confederacy in two and opened the Mississippi to Federal commerce
and control. From the telling force of these simultaneous blows the
Confederacy never recovered.</p>
<p>On March 9, 1864, Grant was placed in supreme command of all
Federal armies. Now as never before, the full strength and resources of
the republic were marshalled for a great offensive to be delivered simultaneously
on all fronts. Attaching himself to Meade&rsquo;s army, Grant
crossed the Rapidan on May 4 to launch his overland campaign against
Richmond, while Sherman began the famous march that was to carry
him to Atlanta and the sea.</p>
<p>In the fiercely contested battles of the Wilderness and Spotsylvania
Court House, May 5-6 and 8-21, respectively, Grant largely succeeded
in destroying Lee&rsquo;s offensive power, forcing his retirement upon Richmond.
Repulsed with heavy losses at Cold Harbor, June 3, Grant moved
upon Petersburg again to encounter Lee&rsquo;s army.</p>
<p>Ten months of siege followed as Grant methodically cut the Confederate
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
lifeline. On April 2, Lee evacuated Petersburg with the hope of
reaching the Danville railroad and possibly effecting a junction with
Johnston&rsquo;s forces in North Carolina. Grant&rsquo;s pursuit, however, was rapid
and relentless. The cutting of the escape route by the Danville line and
the disastrous defeat of a large segment of his army in the Battle of
Sayler&rsquo;s Creek forced Lee to move farther westward to Appomattox
Court House. There at dusk, April the 8th, the widening circle of Federal
campfires brought realization that the end had been reached. The next
day Lee surrendered to the magnanimous terms of Grant. On April 26,
Johnston yielded to Sherman and by June all isolated units of the Confederate
forces had laid down their arms.</p>

<h2 id="c20"><br /><span class="small"><i>Guide to the Area</i> (<span class="smaller">SEE <a href="#map3">MAP ON PAGE 48</a>.</span>)</span></h2>
<p>This guide has been prepared to enable the visitor more readily to identify
and appreciate the chief points of historical interest on the two
battlefields. While there are other locations of importance on park property
and on privately owned adjacent lands, those listed below may be
considered the most conspicuous.</p>
<p>Wherever an area, such as Henry Hill and Chinn Ridge, featured
prominently in both battles, its story has been told jointly, rather than
separately. This has been done in order to avoid unnecessary backtracking.
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
It should be observed that the numbers 1 to 9 have been located on
a tour map for the visitor&rsquo;s convenience.</p>
<p>For the purposes of orientation a visit to the museum should precede
a tour of the fields.</p>
<h3>1. HENRY HILL.</h3>
<p>Covering an area of approximately 200 acres, the top
of this plateau embraces parts of the old Henry Farm and of the Robinson
tract. It extends roughly northeast from the Henry woods to Lee
Highway near the site of the Robinson House. Twice the hill held the
key to victory. After hours of heavy fighting in the first battle, its loss
to McDowell proved a significant factor in the collapse of Federal resistance,
while in the second, its stubborn defense secured the retreat of
Pope&rsquo;s Army over Bull Run.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig34">
<img src="images/p037.jpg" alt="Looking west across Henry Hill to the Administration-Museum Building. The Jackson Monument is shown in the left foreground." width="500" height="294" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Looking west across Henry Hill to the Administration-Museum Building. The Jackson Monument is shown in the left foreground.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Some of the points of special interest here include:</p>
<p><i>Administration-Museum Building.</i> On a commanding rise of the hill is
located the Administration and Museum Building, which represents the
focal center in the interpretation of the area. From the terrace on the
north and east sides of the building, a sweeping panoramic view may be
had of the valley of Young&rsquo;s Branch and the hills beyond which constitute
the chief scenes of tactical maneuver of the two battles.</p>
<p><i>Jackson Monument.</i> Located approximately 125 yards east of the Administration-Museum
Building is the equestrian statue of &ldquo;Stonewall&rdquo;
Jackson. It was erected by the State of Virginia in 1940, reputedly on
the spot where he received his famous nickname. To a large degree Jackson&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
character and personality dominated the fighting of both First and
Second Manassas.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig35">
<img src="images/p038.jpg" alt="Diorama in the museum depicting incident when Jackson was given the name &ldquo;Stonewall.&rdquo;" width="500" height="329" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Diorama in the museum depicting incident when Jackson was given the name &ldquo;Stonewall.&rdquo;</i></p>
</div>
<p><i>Line of Confederate Batteries.</i> Just north of Jackson&rsquo;s statue are markers
indicating the position of Confederate batteries of 26 guns which engaged
the 11 guns of Ricketts&rsquo; and Griffin&rsquo;s Federal batteries at a distance
of about 330 yards. With this furious artillery duel the first battle
reached its crisis. Today, cannon mark this position.</p>
<p><i>Bee Monument.</i> South of the Jackson statue, about 100 feet, stands a
white marble monument erected to the memory of Gen. Barnard E. Bee,
who fell mortally wounded at this spot in the first battle. Shortly before,
while desperately attempting to rally his men, Bee had won immortal
fame with the stirring battle cry which gave Jackson the name of
&ldquo;Stonewall.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bartow Monument.</i> About 180 feet north of the Jackson statue is a
stone block bearing a bronze tablet erected to the memory of Col. F. S.
Bartow, commander of the 2d brigade of Johnston&rsquo;s army, who was
killed in the first battle on this spot. At a critical moment in the early
phase of the battle, Bee and Bartow had given Evans valiant support.</p>
<p><i>Position of Ricketts&rsquo; and Griffin&rsquo;s Guns.</i> Just south of the Henry House
are cannon and markers indicating the advanced position occupied by
the Union batteries of Ricketts and Griffin during the first battle. In a
surprise attack, which practically annihilated these two gallant batteries,
Ricketts was severely wounded.</p>
<p><i>Henry House.</i> About 650 feet northwest of the Administration-Museum
Building stands the Henry House which was erected shortly after
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
the war on the site of the famous original structure. During the first
battle, the original little house was caught in the line of cross artillery
fire which killed its owner, Mrs. Judith Henry. Badly damaged, it suffered
further mutilation during the following year. By the end of the
second battle the house was a complete ruin.</p>
<p><i>Grave of Judith Henry.</i> In the Henry yard, a few feet west of the
house, is the grave of the widow, Judith Henry, enclosed by an iron railing
and shrubbery. She is said to have been buried here by Confederate
soldiers the day after the first battle. A son and daughter are also interred
here. Mrs. Henry&rsquo;s tragic death is dramatically treated in Stephen Vincent
Benet&rsquo;s poem, &ldquo;John Brown&rsquo;s Body.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Union Monument.</i> This pyramidal monument of reddish brown stone,
located in the yard on the east side of the Henry House, was erected by
Union soldiers in 1865 to the memory of their comrades who fell in the
first battle. It is one of the earliest memorial monuments of the Civil
War.</p>
<h3>2. ROBINSON HOUSE.</h3>
<p>About 800 yards northeast of the Administration-Museum
Building, on a projecting spur, stands the Robinson House on
the site of the wartime structure owned by the free Negro, James Robinson.
No part of the present house is original, though a section of it dates
to about 1888. The original house was torn down in 1926 to permit the
construction of the larger portion of the present structure. Suffering
little damage in the first battle, the original house and fields were sacked
by Sigel&rsquo;s Federal troops in the second battle. For these damages Robinson
was awarded $1,249 by Congress in a Private Act of March 3, 1873.
A picturesque view unfolds from this point eastward across Bull Run
and westward to the mountains.</p>
<h3>3. STONE BRIDGE.</h3>
<p>The Stone Bridge and the stream, Bull Run, that
flows beneath it are inseparably linked with the story of the two battles
of Manassas. Located on the Warrenton Turnpike, approximately 1&frac12;
miles east of its intersection with the Manassas-Sudley Road, it formed,
during the first battle, the anchor of the Confederate left and the objective
of the Federal diversion under Tyler. Following the rout of McDowell&rsquo;s
forces, it constituted one of the main avenues of escape. In the
second battle, it was the main route of the Federal advance and retreat.
Though the bridge was destroyed a number of times, the abutments are
original. The present Lee Highway bridge crosses Bull Run about 100
feet south of the old structure which is now memorialized by the State
of Virginia.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<h3>4. STONE HOUSE (MATTHEWS).</h3>
<p>Built in the early part of the nineteenth
century, this two-and-one-half story structure of reddish brown native
stone, stands as the best preserved and most conspicuous landmark on
the two battlefields. It is located on the north side of Lee Highway, near
its junction with the Manassas-Sudley Road. Here the tides of battle
twice engulfed it as it served alternately as a hospital for the wounded
of each side. Shells may still be seen embedded in its walls. For a number
of years after the war it was operated as a tavern.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig37">
<img src="images/p040.jpg" alt="The Stone House." width="500" height="268" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The Stone House.</i></p>
</div>
<h3>5. CHINN RIDGE.</h3>
<p>This commanding ridge was twice utilized by the
Confederates in turning movements that brought defeat to Federal arms.
In the first battle, the brigades of Early and Elzey, supported by Beckham&rsquo;s
artillery, hurled back the Federal right under Howard to precipitate
a general rout of the Federal army. In the second, Longstreet&rsquo;s troops
swept forward to seize the ridge in an attack that, but for the successful
defense of Henry Hill, would have turned the Federal left. The ridge is
served by a park road which terminates at a commanding overlook at its
northern end.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig38">
<img src="images/p041.jpg" alt="Looking east from Chinn Ridge to Henry Hill, showing the nature of the terrain that saw heavy fighting in both battles. The Henry House is shown on the left: the Administration-Museum Building in center of photograph." width="500" height="314" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Looking east from Chinn Ridge to Henry Hill, showing the nature of the terrain that saw heavy fighting in both battles. The Henry House is shown on the left: the Administration-Museum Building in center of photograph.</i></p>
</div>
<p><i>Site of the Chinn House.</i> Only the foundation walls and the bases of
two massive chimneys remain to attest what was once one of the most
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
spacious residences on the Manassas battlefields. Built reputedly in the
late eighteenth century, the house derived its name from Benjamin T.
Chinn, who purchased the property in 1853. Twice used as a field hospital,
it stood until 1950 when, in ruinous condition, it was dismantled.</p>
<p><i>Webster Monument.</i> About 600 yards north of the Chinn House stands
a granite boulder with bronze plaque marking the spot where Col.
Fletcher Webster, son of the statesman, Daniel Webster, fell mortally
wounded in the second battle, August 30, 1862. The boulder was
brought from &ldquo;Marshfield,&rdquo; Mass., the estate of the elder Webster.</p>
<p><i>Chinn Spring.</i> Located on the north side of the Chinn House Road,
a few yards from the little stream known as Chinn Branch, is Chinn
Spring. Following the heat of battle, many of the exhausted and wounded
soldiers of both armies came here to drink gratefully from its cool,
bubbling waters. It is an attractive spot, shaded by tall oaks and marked
by grass that is always green.</p>
<h3>6. UNFINISHED RAILROAD.</h3>
<p>About 300 yards south of the present
Sudley Church, the old grade of an independent line of the Manassas
Gap Railroad crosses the Manassas-Sudley Road (Virginia Route 234).
Stretching southwestward from this point for a distance of nearly 2 miles
is the section of the grade occupied by Jackson&rsquo;s troops during the
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
second battle. From this protecting screen he first revealed his position
in the attack on King&rsquo;s column on August 28. Here, in the next 2 days,
he successfully repelled repeated Federal assaults. Though brush and
trees have grown up along much of it, the grade is still clearly defined.</p>
<h3>7. SUDLEY CHURCH.</h3>
<p>Just west of the Manassas-Sudley Road, near its
intersection with the Groveton-Sudley Road (Virginia Route 622),
stands Sudley Church on the approximate site of the wartime structure
that twice served as a hospital. In the first battle, the Federal wounded
overflowed the church into a number of neighboring houses.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig39">

<p class="pcap"><i>Wartime photograph of the Sudley Church.</i> Courtesy Library of Congress.</p>
</div>
<h3>8. &ldquo;DEEP CUT.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Approximately three-quarters of a mile northwest of
Groveton and immediately in front of the old railroad grade is &ldquo;Deep
Cut,&rdquo; scene of the bitterest fighting of the second battle. Here the troops
of Fitz-John Porter suffered terrific losses in gallant but vain attempts to
penetrate Jackson&rsquo;s defenses. Heavy woods have now grown up in what
was then open land largely obscuring the shaft of reddish brown stone
erected to the memory of the Union troops who fell there. Most of the
land of the &ldquo;Deep Cut&rdquo; area is not at present owned by the park.</p>
<h3>9. THE DOGAN HOUSE.</h3>
<p>Here at Groveton, at the intersection of the
Groveton-Sudley Road and Lee Highway, is located the Dogan House,
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
one of the main landmarks of the second battle. It was across this area,
on August 29, that Hood&rsquo;s division drove back the Union division of
Hatch before it retired to the west of Groveton. The next day the area
was involved in heavy artillery and infantry fire.</p>
<p>The small, one-story house of weather-boarded logs originally served
as the overseer&rsquo;s house of the Dogan farm. Later, it was occupied by the
Dogan family after their main house had burned. Like the Stone House,
it now stands as one of the two remaining original structures in the park.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig40">

<p class="pcap"><i>The Dogan House.</i></p>

<h2 id="c21"><br /><span class="small"><i>The Park</i></span></h2>
<p>Manassas National Battlefield Park was designated a Federal area May
10, 1940. The 1,670.74 acres of federally owned land in the park comprise
portions of the two battlefields.</p>
<p>One of the initial steps in the memorialization of these fields was
taken in 1922 with the purchase of the Henry Farm, of approximately
128 acres, by the Manassas Battlefield Confederate Park, Inc., and the
Sons of Confederate Veterans. On March 19, 1938, the Henry Farm was
conveyed by deed to the United States Government as an &ldquo;everlasting
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
memorial to the soldiers of the Blue and Gray.&rdquo; Significant additions to
park holdings were made in 1949 with the acquisition of the historic
Stone House and Dogan House properties.</p>
<h2 id="c22"><br /><span class="small"><i>How to Reach the Park</i></span></h2>
<p>The park is situated in Prince William County, Va., 26 miles southwest
of Washington, D. C. State Route 234 intersects United States Highways
Nos. 29 and 211 at the park boundary.</p>
<h2 id="c23"><br /><span class="small"><i>Administration</i></span></h2>
<p>Manassas National Battlefield Park is administered by the National Park
Service of the United States Department of the Interior. Communications
should be addressed to the Superintendent, Manassas National
Battlefield Park, Manassas, Va.</p>
<h2 id="c24"><br /><span class="small"><i>Related Areas</i></span></h2>
<p>Other Civil War battlefields in Virginia administered by the National
Park Service include: Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military
Park, Richmond National Battlefield Park, Petersburg National Military
Park, and Appomattox Court House National Monument.</p>
<h2 id="c25"><br /><span class="small"><i>Visitor Facilities</i></span></h2>
<p>A modern museum and battlefield markers are features of the park&rsquo;s
interpretive program. The museum, which is highlighted by a diorama
and an electric map, presents exhibits in such a way as to develop the
story of both battles in narrative sequence. Free literature, library facilities,
and interpretive services are also available at the museum. Special
tours can be arranged for organizations and groups if advance notice is
given to the superintendent. Museum hours are from 9 a. m. to 5 p. m.
daily.</p>

<div class="fnblock"><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_1" href="#fr_1">[1]</a>For his failure to carry out Pope&rsquo;s order of the 29th to attack Jackson, Porter was
court-martialed and dismissed from the army on January 21, 1863. In 1879, a board of
general officers who reviewed the case held that Porter could not have attacked Jackson
successfully, as ordered, because Longstreet&rsquo;s corps had moved up into position on the
right of Jackson and opposite Porter, and that this was known to the latter. Thus, Pope&rsquo;s
order, which was written without knowledge of this development, could not be carried
out. President Arthur, in 1882, remitted that part of the sentence which disqualified Porter
from holding any office of trust or profit under the Government of the United States. On
August 5, 1886, Porter was reappointed colonel of infantry, and 2 days later placed on the
retirement list. To this day, despite his final vindication, the controversy over Porter&rsquo;s
action on August 29, 1862, at Second Manassas has not died down among military
students.
